title: Fermat's Last Theorem
abstract: A highly entertaining, informative and gripping account of how one of the most celebrated problems in mathematics was solved by Andrew Wiles. In addition to being sprinkled with memorable anecdotes, nearly all the major concepts involved have been explained with an uncanny clarity.
author: Simon Singh

*Language*: Enjoyable.

*Impression (long)*: The book develops both the mathematical ideas from scratch and the personalities of the geniuses complete with their social environment. I will try to distil the mathematical ideas and present some of the stories I found interesting, separately.



Story

The centrepiece of the discussion is the generalisation of Pythagoras theorem. Pythagoras theorem is $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ for a right angle angle triangle with sides $$a,b$$ and $$c$$ where $$c$$ is the length of the side opposite the right angle. One can easily find integer solutions to the aforesaid, e.g. $$a=3,b=4$$ and $$c=5$$. Fermat's last "theorem" was that the equation $$a^n + b^n = c^n $$ for $$n\in{3,4,\dots}$$ has no integer solutions.

This problem was open for a while. *Euler* proved the case for $$n=3$$, *Sophie Germain* invented a method that could destroy an entire section of prime cases, Cauchy and Lamé claimed to have almost found the proof but Kummer sniffed the flaw with their logic, they were assuming unique factorisation (meaning $$21=7\times 3$$ has a unique prime factorisation) fails to hold when imaginary numbers are introduced. This meant that there was no known way of tackling all irregular primes at once.

Dot conjecture evaded a solution for decades but was solved by a clever argument. Fermat's Last Theorem (or conjecture) could belong to this class. Or it could simply be undecidable. 

Aside: Wolfskehl was depressed after being rejected by a woman. This episode (details in the book) led him to set up an award of 100,000 Marks for the first person to prove Fermat's Theorem to be true. There was no reward for the person who found a counter-example.

Decidability has its roots in David Hilbert's programme that was designed to achieve the belief "everything in mathematics could and should be proved from the basic axioms." The other requirement was that of consistency, viz. mathematics should be free of inconsistencies—if something is proved true by one method, it shouldn't be possible to show it's false by another method. Frege had made remarkable progress in Hilbert's programme. Then unwittingly, Russels ended up finding a contradiction which arose from Frege's own work making mathematics inconsistent (TODO: add Russel's paradox from the book). There were then efforts to fix things and it seemed like "mathematics was on the road to recovery". This was to receive a fatal blow by Gödel's work which proved that "trying to construct a complete and consistent mathematical system was an impossible task". Roughly, the first theorem was (completeness): *If an axiomatic set theory is consistent, then there exist theorems which can neither be proved or disproved.* The second theorem was (proving consistency): *There is no constructive procedure which will prove on axiomatic theory to be consistent*. 

Elliptic equations and Modular Forms: (TODO: Introduce E-series and M-series)

Shimura and Taniyama conjecture: (TODO: Elliptic equations and modular forms are related)

André Weil

Frey finds a connection: (TODO:)

Ken Ribet (with Mazur's cappuccino assistance): Fixed Frey's argument after eighteen months of effort. (TODO:)

Proof by induction: First term of E matches the first term of M, then second and so on. Wiles's new approach, first E terms of all match first M terms of all. "(three years) Galios groups applied to elliptic equations, broken the elliptic equations into an infinite number of pieces, and proved that the first piece of every elliptic equation had to be modular."

For the inductive step, Wiles used an unfamiliar method, known as the Kolyvagin-Flach method. Was helped by Katz to examine correctness. After the public announcement, there was a dissastisfaction with the Kolyvagin-Flach method. Wiles spent months trying to fix. Couldn't. Even got his former student under his wing. Failed. Tried going back to the old Iwasawa method. Also failed. Admitted defeat. Then one day, he had the revelation that the "Iwasawa theory on its own had been inadequate. The Kolyvagin-Flach method on its own was also inadequate. Together they complemented each other perfectly."

In between there was high drama: (TODO:)





Characters

Pythagoras: This came as a shock. He had sentenced a student of his to death by drowning because he had proved the existence of irrational numbers which was against Pythagoras's belief that only counting numbers (and rationals I guess) must exist (TODO: fix this).

Euler: He would calculate like people breath. Lost an eye to cataract and claimed "Now I will have less distraction".

Sophie Germain: Started studying mathematics because she had read that Archimedes was "so engrossed in the study of a geometric figure in the sand that he failed to respond to the questioning of a Roman soldier. As a result he was speared to death." (The Roman army had invaded Syracuse.)  Her logic was that if somebody could be so consumed by a geometric problem that it could lead to their death, then mathematics must have been the most captivating subject in the world.

David Hilbert: "Meine Herren, I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission as a Privatdozent (lecturer I suppose). After all, the Senate is not a bathhouse."

Galois: Only maths, duel, wrote everything he'd thought of in one night; failed the polytechnique test twice; second time threw the duster on the examiner; father's reputation was maligned (inaccurately I think) committed suicide;
