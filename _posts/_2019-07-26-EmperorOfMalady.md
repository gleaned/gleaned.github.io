**Notes**

* Leukaemia: There's acute and chronic. The former suddenly erupts. The latter gradually. It's a blood disease (cancer really) where the white blood cells reproduce uncontrollably. In the acute case (sudden eruption) these cells don't even develop completely. 
  This was first chosen for study because it could be measured (draw blood and find the concentration of white blood cells). Other forms of cancer couldn't even be handled. 
  * Vitamin B in one of the cases played a role. TODO: recall
  * In the case with malnourished workers in colonial India, there was another chemical involved (creatine? no; ATP? I forgot; perhaps it was Folic Acid)
  * Folic Acid for Leukaemia in children made it worse; an anti-biotic was suggested. This seemed to miraculously work, but only for a while.



**Interesting Personal Takeaways**

* Farber, he was 
* Val (forgot his name), he had had his medical training in India(?) but his license didn't work in the US. He worked as a staff member in a hospital, changing sheets and cleaning urinals. Ran into Farber, started a day job as a researcher, went on to develop ways of isolating ATP and creatine (power carriers in muscles); eventually to producing some biochemicals (like Folic Acid  I guess) and then later, chemicals that behaved as anti-biotics for these biochemicals.
