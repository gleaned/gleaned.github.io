*Language*: Enjoyable.

*Impression (long)*: 



**Notes**

* Primary emphasis was on changing a culture. How?
  * Updated Microsoft's vision (a PC at every desk had been accomplished and even made obsolete); something every element of the large association can associate with.
  * Stopped simply chasing the competition; don't revere the competitor but have respect.
  * Foster an environment of creativity
    * Smartest person in the room attitude kills creativity
    * Always learning attitude
    * Inspire by acting (see the next point)
  * Change cultures at the top; 
    * Listen to people first about their current stance.
    * Convince them of what you're saying; evolve your idea through constructive discussions
    * (see stories for explicit examples)
* More empathy, have individuals find their inner goals and let it be implemented through their work
* Various stories sparkled throughout
  * Retreat: Only top members earlier; invited customers; better bond and understanding of what's needed; invited junior members as well; same;
  * Hired a culture/psych-something
  *
