title: My stroke of insight, Jill Bolte Taylor
---

Language: I liked the language, it was vivid, expressive and informative (I don't recall it being pretentious or ostentatious). 
Style: It was nice but at times annoyingly repetitive. Would've been much more pleasant if it were concise.

Impression (short): This book rather interesting for me personally. It gave a neurological explanation of what I can't even conceive. A world without reason, without language, without the notion of past and future. Turns out we all posses this part and it is the right brain in both senses of the word right. It also explained how the left brain with all its categorisation skills also elevates levels of sadness and introduces the notion of self which seems to be at the heart of all misery.
