abstract: 
author: Oliver Sacks

*Language*: Enjoyable.

*Impression (long)*: 



**Notes**

* Interplay between the romantic and the factual
  * Going from being impersonal while recording patient information to reverting to recording the individual person's behaviour; becomes rather important for neuroscience
  * Mapping function to areas in the left brain. Too simplistic. The right brain is poorly understood. Has the notion of self somehow encoded in it.
* Story 1: The man who mistook his wife for a hat
  * Musician who's good at his job
  * Fails to see the full picture; while talking, would fixate on different parts of the face
  * After a medical examination, fails to put on his shoe; then confuses his foot for the shoe; later his wife for his hat.
