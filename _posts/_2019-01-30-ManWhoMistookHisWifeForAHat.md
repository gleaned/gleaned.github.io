author: Oliver Sacks

*Language*: Enjoyable.

*Impression (long)*: 



**Notes**

* Interplay between the romantic and the factual
  * Going from being impersonal while recording patient information to reverting to recording the individual person's behaviour; becomes rather important for neuroscience
  * Mapping function to areas in the left brain. Too simplistic. The right brain is poorly understood. Has the notion of self somehow encoded in it.

* Story 1: The man who mistook his wife for a hat
  * Musician who's good at his job
  * Fails to see the full picture; while talking, would fixate on different parts of the face
  * After a medical examination, fails to put on his shoe; then confuses his foot for the shoe; later his wife for his hat.

* Story 2: Hell freezes
  * Amnesia of a certain kind. 
  * Person frozen in time.
  * Smart but couldn't even remember enough to be hypnotized.
  * Would get mad at curtains being changed at his home.
  * When asked how he was feeling, didn't have an answer.

* Story 3: Watch yourself
  * Strapping young woman
  * Couldn't control her body; rather feel her body unless she saw it
  * Had a dream suggesting something to this end might happen
  * Became functional but never completely recovered to the prior state
  * Societal bias was a trial; appeared to be drunk or blind/drunk; no solicitude evoked

* Story 4: Foreign Leg
  * Someone else's leg, facsimile of his leg he claimed, threw it out of his bed
  * Went down with it; it was his own leg

* Story 5: Hands and Dexterity
  * A congenitally blind woman unable to use her hands
  * Could still feel individual elements on her hands but couldn't construct a whole "image"
  * After being tricked into using her hands, gradually she became so good, she could sculpt recognisable sculptures; came to be known as the Blind Sculptress

* Story 6: Phantoms

  * Various; some mentions:
    * Amputee with an artificial limb needs it included in the body-image. 
      One patient would wake the phantom up in the morning!
    * There are good and bad phantoms; pain of an ingrown toenail on a limb that doesn't exist anymore. Anesthetising the spinous "ligament" also anesthetised the phantom pain.

* Story 7: Tilt

  * A man thinking he's walking straight as a dice but was tilting almost enough to fall.
  * Guessed the problem to be with the "spirit level" of his brainâ€”labyrinthine.
  * Three part system controls the balance: labyrinthine, visual and proprioceptive.
  * Invented glasses with a spirit level; now balances well.
