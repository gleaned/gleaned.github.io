### Formation of planets

It starts with discussing the earlier philosophical ideas. One was about there being an envelope around the sun which ended up forming the planetary system. The other was about a comet or some such colliding with the Sun resulting in the planetary system. None of these were mathematically studied. Apparently Kant was involved in one of these.
