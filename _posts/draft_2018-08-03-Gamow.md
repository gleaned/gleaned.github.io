*Language:* Enjoyably rich and not overly pompous like some; 

*Style:* Very nicely written and illustrated as well.

## Bullets for the valentine

The book has some seriously interesting insights, even for someone who has already studied the topics formally.

* What's the largest number you can think of?
* Topology
* Micro structures
  * Measuring the weight of an atom
* Size of the universe
* Formation of planets



### Formation of planets

It starts with discussing the earlier philosophical ideas. One was about there being an envelope around the sun which ended up forming the planetary system. The other was about a comet or some such colliding with the Sun resulting in the planetary system. None of these were mathematically studied. Apparently Kant was involved in one of these.

### Star Formation

I should probably have read about stars early on but my no GK book policy (which amounts to not reading popular physics books until I already know the physics behind it) hindered any such possibility. 

<add a brief summary of star formation>

### Trajectorial Serendipity

I was reading the star formation section when the book mentioned H. Bethe who figured the Carbon cycle which is used to fuse Hydrogen and it became the sole candidate for explaining the luminosity and life of the sun; thus it answered the question: Why does the sun shine?

I was also watching the Nobel Lecture by Haldane (Kishor had mentioned his name to me earlier). And, wouldn't you be surprised to note that, H. Bethe had apparently made some interesting contribution to a problem in condensed matter before tackling the astrophysical problem of the sun. He had solved this in some specific dimension, I think two, and then had stated he'd generalise it later. Haldane then explained that while the solution was fine, why it worked took some twenty years of further development. Now it is clear that it works only in that specific dimension and would fail otherwise indicating that Bethe also did not know about this even though he found a solution.
