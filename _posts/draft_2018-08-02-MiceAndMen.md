*Language*: Most dialogues are written to additionally convey the accent used. I did not find that very helpful. Otherwise, of course, well written.


*Impression (long)*: A story about two friends. It is well written, almost as a play with different chapters almost acting as single scenes. The story itself, however, I did not quite like. The first friend (I still don't remember his name, damn it) is the relatively smart one. The second is good at heart, but stupid, forgetful (stop looking at me) and inadvertently ends up causing trouble.
