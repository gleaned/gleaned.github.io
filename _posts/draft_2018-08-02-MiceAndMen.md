*Language*: Most dialogues are written to additionally convey the accent used. I did not find that very helpful. Otherwise, of course, well written.

*Impression (long)*: A story about two friends. It is well written, almost as a play with different chapters almost acting as single scenes. The story itself, however, I did not quite like. The first friend (I still don't remember his name, damn it) is the relatively smart one. The second is good at heart, big (and strong) but stupid, forgetful (stop looking at me) and inadvertently ends up causing trouble. 

The book does a good job at painting this picture and making the reader get attached with the characters. It also keeps developing the story in a way that the reader stays hooked. For instance (spoiler alert) in the beginning the characters are evidently escaping something but it is only later that we learn what and why. 

Returning to the story, the short fellow doesn't seem to be sure if he wants to take care of the big fellow but this sentiment seems to only be on the surface. Their characters are developed a little through the description of the dinner scene. The main quirk of the big guy is that he likes to pet things, so much so that he would even pet a dead mouse if he is unable to find something else. This is what got them in trouble in the first place (he was petting a woman's cloth; when she realised and tried to retract it, he panicked and held it even more tightly; the woman reported he tried to rape him.) and it is this that leads to the end of the story.
