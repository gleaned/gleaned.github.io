author: Graham Farmelo

*Presentation*: Rather well written and researched.

*Impression (long)*: 



**Notes**

* Towards the end, seemed fixated on Mathematical beauty, even though it seemed to have driven him astray
* Said to a friend "My life has been a failure".
* Had suggested that matter might be made of string like objects instead of particles
* Tried working out electrodynamics (classical) without infinities; thought this was the cause of all issues



Lessons

* Don't write a book with only numbers for chapters and marginally related quotations at the start of each chapter (makes it hard to take notes!)
